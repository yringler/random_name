Created to compare with the dart example (https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)

I went through the code lab on dart, and was curious how it compares to nativescript.
I didn't replicate all the functionality (and it looks terrible), but from what I put together I think it's a ton easier to do with nativescript.

Nativescript uses old, boring, programming styles that I'm familiar with; flutter seems to introduce a lot of cool, shiny stuff and ways of doing things- but it's also very different than what anyone is used to.

There is no doubt that flutter is an excellent system, but personally I don't see any need to jump on it.
